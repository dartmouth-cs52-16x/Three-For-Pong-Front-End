## Deployment

How to Deploy the Project:

Currently, the project is set up to run on a local server. So, first set up the server with mongod. For instance, create any directory to store data and then run

mongod --dbpath <path to data directory>

Then, while mongod is still running, go to the directory of HackHubAPIServer. There, run

npm run dev

This should set up the local server on localhost:9090. The current project is set up to use this server, so it should run correctly.

To test the project, run

npm start

and go to localhost:8080.
